-7.836623449649116E-4

Methodology:
Building on best_hospitals, I ran a correlation between normalized scores and survey results.  Based on my methods, I found that the two are not correlated

Conclusion:
The answer agrees with my hypothesis that low revisits and high care do not correlate with consumer (patient) satisfaction.  While satisfaction may be a useful metric for business development, it appears to have no bearing on effective medical practice.
