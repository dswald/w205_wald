The above represents the highest ranking procedures by hospital which answers a more interesting question to my mind.

Methodology:
The query is to join scores between effective care (scale between 0-1180) and readmission score (scale between 0-~36 max).  I chose to ignore survey results as the question is which is the best hospital, not which is the most liked hospital.

+Before joining, I needed to eliminate text data that was non-continuous (what does "medium" mean in this context?) and convert the readmission score to an approximate scale of 0-100.  
+I assumed that readmissions are bad based on "worse than national average" ranging high wheras "better" has a larger distribution. This leads me to believe that the score indicates an average count of readmissions per instance, so I inverted the numbers and divided by the maximum.

+I ignored number of instances in this case which gives me heartburn, but I'm out of time.  Given more time, I would have normalized the data by the number of samples / denominator.

+After the scales were normalized, I joined using UNION ALL function to create a new table that can perform further analysis without re-processing and then queried this new table "best_hospitals" to obtain the average score grouped by provider and measure to identify the best hospital by service.  

+To the question of best aggrigate hospital:
+To find the aggrigate by hospitals, one simply needs to remove the measure_id from the GROUP BY statement.  
+I included this as a second query within best_hospitals.sql to answer the original question with output, below:

400003  0.11736909976594381
430082  0.10084745762711864

39001F  0.08418079096045199
51004F  0.08411016949152542



^ This is a far different answer than I expected!  Only one common hospital, 400003.

Conclusion:
Based on the data queried from effective care and readmissions, we can see that there is a vast divide between what is called "effective" based on number of re-admissions.  When splitting by measures, it is clear that some measures are cureable (acute) while others require many visits (chronic).  From what I know about medicine, the answers to my query aggree with baseline.  400003 is likely lucky in that it has fewer chronic problems than the rest.  

If I were to spend more time digging in, I would split the dataset in two by measure_id which indicates acute vs. chronic ailmentsni order to determine the best hospitals for both kinds of problems.
